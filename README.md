For your exercise, create a Angular app that allows a user to Register for an account with the following information:

- Name
- Email
- Password

On success, redirect the User to a Dashboard page that displays Sidebar, Top Nav bar and a layout. 

- Side Bar: Dashboard
- Top Nav Bar: Notifications button, profile button and logout button - a `logout` mechanism so the User can log out of the session.
- Layout: Highcharts to display sample covid data - use some open source covid api (refer: https://covidtracking.com/)

Note: use Angular Material, Highcharts, Flex Layout

Then, create a form to allow the User to login with their email and password.  Redirect the User to Dashboard.

No backend is needed, but connecting to a service like **Google FireBase** for User management or something similar is a HUGE plus.
